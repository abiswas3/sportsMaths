<p><strong><u>Disclaimer</u></strong>: I am not an athlete nor can I
claim to be a hardcore triathlon fan. I am not directly affected by the
outcome of different ranking strategies, financially or spiritually. My
interest in the problem is purely from an algorithmic game theory
standpoint. Ranking strategies often lead to pathological behaviours (<a
href="https://youtu.be/TM_QFmQU_VA?t=494">see</a> for an example).
Understanding and analysing the mathematical underpinnings of such
behaviour is a personal research interest. Note as these systems rank
actual people with feelings and were developed by a different set of
humans (also with feelings), I have tried to remain as neutral as
possible in my discourse. In the off chance someone is offended, I
apologise.</p>
</div>
<p>This document can be viewed as an example of an educated guess at a
solution (but not a principled one)</p>
<h1 id="part-ii--introduction">Part II -Introduction</h1>
<p>In <a href="http://abiswas3.github.io/blog/ProblemStatement/">a
previous post</a> we described in detail why we believed the current
ranking system to be sub-optimal. In this document, we motivate a new
system for ranking triathletes, under new assumptions. We call our
algorithm <strong>Tommy Rank</strong> - dedicated to <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/tomvickery/?hl=en">Tom Vickery</a> who
introduced this problem to me. We propose variants of our algorithm and
allow the reader to compare the outcome against the current system.
Although Tommy Rank is not theoretically justified in itself, we can
make a connection with the well understood <a
href="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/PlackettLuce/vignettes/Overview.html">Plackett-Luce
model</a> for ranking, that has been studied in detail for over fifty
years. For now, we decided to go with Tommy rank owing to its simplicity
and transparency. You should not read too much into the rankings
proposed by Tommy Ranking. Retrospective rankings are unfair to begin
with – we tell you why in <a href="../PrimoRank/">part III</a></p>
<h2 id="a-brief-summary-of-what-did-not-work">A brief summary of what
did not work</h2>
<p>Now we address the issues of the current system. We have already
described in detail how the current scoring system does not align with
the motivation of the sport. Here we list the major points only. For a
detailed study refer to <a
href="http://abiswas3.github.io/blog/ProblemStatement/">this
work</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ait-is-not-calibrated-with-what-perceived-difficulty">AIT is not
calibrated with what perceived difficulty</h3>
<p>In our opinion this is the biggest disadvantage of the current
system. Based on the discussions we have had so far, athletes value
certain races higher than others because of the strength of the field.
While the performance of an athlete is not affected by the strength of
field, their final position in the race is. In section<a
href="http://abiswas3.github.io/blog/ProblemStatement/">“I beat the best
athletes and was worse off for it”</a> we show how often this happens.
If you did not read the previous post, here is a couple of choice
examples, Fenella Langridge was awarded 82 points for finishing 7th in
Challenge Day, while Nikki Bartlett received 83 points for placing third
in Eton Dorney Triathlon. Similarly, Lucy Hall won 87 points at Eton for
a second place, whereas Amelia Watkinson earned 88 for a 5th at
Challenge Daytona. Popular consensus from interviewing fans and athletes
was that a top 6 at Challenge Daytona was a bigger accomplishment and
should be rewarded accordingly. The system is flawed by design - As an
athlete one can only beat other athletes they are faced with. Without
prior knowledge of the maximum available points, it is impossible for an
athlete to seek out races with meaningful points. The system must
encourage the best to compete with the best. Only then can the rankings
be taken seriously. The AIT score as exists today is more of an opinion
than a mathematical model.</p>
<p>In <a href="../PrimoRank/">part III</a> we carry out multiple case
studies that demonstrate that AIT is likely to be uncorrelated with
perceived difficulty. (NOTE: We did not run an experiment to verify that
claim. It is a conjecture.)</p>
<h3 id="it-leaves-athletes-and-fans-in-the-dark">It leaves athletes and
fans in the dark</h3>
<p>Triathlon is a spectator sport. The current ranking system has been
described as too complex <a
href="https://www.triathlete.com/culture/news/how-pro-triathletes-are-now-being-ranked-and-not-everyones-happy-about-it/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=triathletemag&amp;utm_campaign=68839c2e-e9b8-4432-a616-63ec9eaf6e06">by</a>.
Shown below are the results of the Dorney Lake Triathlon.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/dorney.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>The screenshot was taken on June 15th, 2021. The race concluded 2
days ago. The athletes still do not know how many points they collected.
Given these scores are used to rank athletes and qualify for the collins
cup, it is impossible for an athlete to know before hand who they have
to beat or what time they must run to make it into the Collins Cup. <a
href="https://youtu.be/CCCSwYRpBkE?t=432">Linked here</a> is a video by
Lucy Charles where she claims explaining the same issues. Despite
winning comfortably, she did not know how many points she had acquired.
We argue this complexity prevents the average spectator from investing
in the tournament. In the UEFA champions league knockout stages,
everyone is aware of the results that would allow their team to go
through. This knowledge creates pre-game excitement and also allows
teams to set up accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="it-has-no-theoretical-justification-or-transparency">It has no
theoretical justification or transparency</h3>
<p>We’re aware most readers would not consider this to be a weakness.
One of the advantages of ELO based rankings is that has a rich history
of mathematical justification. The approach is designed with assumptions
clearly stated. Note: This does not imply the system is perfect.</p>
<p>It implies there is a reasonable understanding of the current flaws
in the system. The understanding of how and why the scores are updated
in ELO are transparent. This allows us to fix perceived biases and
moments of discrimination. <a
href="http://www.glicko.net/research.html">Glickman</a> wrote his phD
thesis understanding these rankings and debating its implications and
flaws. The same cannot be said for AIT. Why did we pick top 3 races in a
year? Why does 0.15% difference result in 1 point advantage? How is AIT
calculated? What are the justifications for that formula. Although, we
acknowledge these questions might appeal more to academics than average
fans and athletes, we have shown that over simplification can lead to
discrimination of courses.</p>
<p>At the very least, in absence of rigour, a scoring system should be
simple and fair. The current system seems complex and theoretically
unjustified, which is the worst of both worlds.</p>
<h3 id="it-treats-70.3-and-im-as-the-same">It treats 70.3 and IM as the
same</h3>
<p>Popular consensus is that the skill does not always transfer as well.
I am not an athlete and am not qualified to assert this claim but it has
been cited <a
href="https://www.triathlete.com/culture/news/how-pro-triathletes-are-now-being-ranked-and-not-everyones-happy-about-it/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=triathletemag&amp;utm_campaign=68839c2e-e9b8-4432-a616-63ec9eaf6e06">here</a></p>
<h1 id="tommy-rank---a-simpler-ranking-system">Tommy Rank - A Simpler
Ranking System</h1>
<p>No ranking system is perfect. Someone always gains a little and
someone always loses out. There is no free lunch. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">Really! See
this</a> What makes a good ranking system? We argue that it must be</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple and easy to understand. An athlete or a fan should know
before and after a race the exact amount of reward they receive. The
process should be transparent.</li>
<li>Should not be gamed or unfair. It should align with a human
perception of fairness. We would like to say For an athlete A ranked to
be higher than B, we must be able to say that if A raced B often, A
would beat B with high probability. This probability must be justified
with empirical results.</li>
<li>It should align with the incentives of the sport.</li>
</ul>
<p>We acknowledge that these properties are somewhat subjective and not
always quantifiable mathematically. But such is the nature of the world
we live in. Put colloquially, <strong><em>we would like athletes to feel
that they have been screwed over people as infrequently as
possible.</em></strong> We want to do this by clearly stating our
assumptions and justifying our decisions mathematically. For this system
we ignore statistical model and run free with intuition. We frown upon
this but since we already have another approach that’s more principled,
we allow for a heuristic based approach guided by Tom Vickery’s
experience.</p>
<h2
id="notation-and-preliminaries-skip-if-math-notation-is-scary">Notation
and Preliminaries [Skip if math notation is scary]</h2>
<p>Let set <span class="math inline">\(X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N
\}\)</span> represent athlete roster. Let <span class="math inline">\(R
= \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k \}\)</span> represent the k races in a race
calendar. Let <span class="math inline">\(w_i \in \mathbb{R^+}\)</span>
for <span class="math inline">\(i=1, 2, ..., k\)</span> be the perceived
importance of a race. One can also think of <span
class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> as the strength of field of a race.
The world championship races and PTO organised championships are
expected to have higher value <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>
than local races. The points awarded to an athlete are simply based on
their finish position. For a given race <span
class="math inline">\(r_j\)</span>, the points accumulated for finishing
in the i’th position is <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_i*w_j\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_i \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> is an integer. It
represents the value obtained from finishing a certain position. Our
model is already used in Formula 1 (rather we borrow it from F1), where
the winner gets 25 pts, second gets 18, third gets 15 and so on. Using
our notation formula 1 race scoring can be described as <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_1=25, \gamma_2 = 18\)</span> and so on.
With all <span class="math inline">\(w_j=1\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(j=1, 2, ..., k\)</span> as all races are equal. We
denote the points received by an athlete <span
class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> in race <span
class="math inline">\(r_j\)</span> by finishing in position <span
class="math inline">\(p_j\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Q_i(p_j) = \gamma_p*w_j\]</span></p>
<p>We set the score to 0 if the athlete did not participate in a race or
did not finish. Thus the premise is as simple as it can be. The points
you get are based on where you finish in race and everyone knows what
they are before hand. Triathlon’s great issue is that not all races are
equal. This is where the strength of field comes in. Based on how the
strength of field is calculated, the total points accumulated for a race
changes. We will look to address the issues stated in part 1 in the
computation of the strength of field</p>
<p>The final set of scores for an athlete in a calendar year is given
by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ X_i = \{ Q_i(p_1), Q_i(p_2) \dots,
Q_i(p_k) \}\]</span></p>
<p>The final ranking is based on the sum of highest <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> scores. The PTO sets <span
class="math inline">\(m=3\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> can be though represents the
consistency factor. If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is high,
then to be ranked high at the end of the year, the athlete needs to
place high consistently at races. If <span
class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span>, it says having one incredible race
is good enough. The strength of field parameter dictates the maximum
amount of points one can obtain from a race.</p>
<p>So all that is left is to decide what <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> should be and how to calculate
<span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> for race <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The choice of strength of field and
gamma produces a unique alogorithm.</p>
<h2 id="the-above-math-in-simple-words">The above math in simple
words</h2>
<p>The points model is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The points received from a race are like Formula 1 i.e. based on
your position. First gets <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span>
pts, second gets <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_2\)</span> pts and
so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Not all races are equal. Some races are Cat A races like Kona, IM
70.3, Challenge Daytona etc. Some races are Cat B races like IM Tulsa,
IM St.George, Challenge Roth. For any race, there is a formula to
calculate the strength of the race. Based on this score we categorise
the race into different categories. The final score obtained for a race,
is the position score times the strength of field discount. One can
imagine Kona being the pinnacle has a strength of 1. A second tier race
like IM Tulsa has a strength of 0.9. A local race like Wisconsin could
have a strength of 0.7.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume coming first gets you 25pts. If you come first in Kona you
get the full 25pts. Coming first in Tulsa gets you <span
class="math inline">\(0.9*25=22.5\)</span> pts and Wisconsin gets <span
class="math inline">\(0.7*25=17.5\)</span> pts.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on how the strength of field and discount factor is
calculated, we get different methds. In the next section we describe the
different methods.</p></li>
<li><p>The final score for an athlete is simply, the sum of the best 3
races in a year calculated using the above formula. In the case of ties,
we look at head to head record to break ties. If that is tied as well,
then we deem the the athletes to be the same rank.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-mini-rant-not-to-be-taken-personally">A mini rant (not to be
taken personally)</h2>
<p>Take a look at the following performances and tell me who had the
better year? Especially when you only consider the top 3
performances.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/A.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
<img src="pngs/B.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>Both have won multiple races. Both have come second occasionally.
They have never raced head to head and both have occasionally bonked.
One of them was ranked 2nd for the end of the year performance; the
other 15th. We even describe a theorem that says athletes need to race
more to be ranked correctly in <a href="../PrimoRank/">part III</a></p>
<p>If the sport rankings want to be taken seriously, they need to have
real professional races. Lionel Messi does not play in your cities local
Sunday league tournament. Lucy Charles Barclay should not race in Eton
Dorney as a pro either. I know it is part of the culture of triathlon to
let amateurs and pro’s mix but it makes it near impossible to actually
rank and score them. Athletes can race their local races as much as they
like to preserve the culture of triathlon. But they must also race each
other a lot. This can either be achieved my having separate pro races or
we can have the athletes race more if they are able to.</p>
<p>Rant over!</p>
<h1 id="simulations">Simulations</h1>
<p>Instead of describing the algorithms immediately, we allow the reader
to interact with them directly and judge if they are fair. We have
written up multiple variants of our model, to allow the reader to decide
what they find simple and fair.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://abiswas3.github.io/blog/mens_ranking/">COMPARE

</ul>
<p>Do not read too far into this. Retrospective rankings do not work.
Such course grain bucketing of races makes it hard to really compare
athletes.</p>
<h2 id="toms-heuristic-approximate-tommy-rank">Tom’s Heuristic
(Approximate Tommy Rank)</h2>
<p>This method is <strong>NOT</strong> mathmetically justified. It is
based on a set of heuristics that Tom uses based on his experience.
Given that he has been in the sport for over a decade, a ranking system
based on his perceived fairness is not a bad place to start. It is
simple and appeals to intuition. It follows the general model described
above.</p>
<p>Tom does not like Maths. He has no need for theoretical justification
of a ranking system. Tom believes the higher the prize money of a race,
the stiffer the competition. Therefor the points awarded for a race
should be based on prize money. This is not an unreasonable assumption -
If the perceived strength of field does correlate with prize money, it’s
a simple and yet “fair” scoring system.</p>
<p>Also being a motorsport fan, he wants to use the well understood
Formula 1 scoring system because of its simplicity. NOTE: Formula 1 also
did not justify their scoring theoretically, but when something is
simple and perceived fair – you do not need to.</p>
<pre><code>    1st – 25pts
    2nd – 18pts
    3rd – 15pts
    4th – 12pts
    5th – 10pts
    6th – 8pts
    7th – 6pts
    8th – 4pts
    9th – 2pts
    10th – 1pt</code></pre>
<p>So going back to our math notation from before <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_1 = 25, \gamma_2 = 18\)</span> and so on.
For the strengh of field, he claims there are 3 types of races. Category
A which is for Kona, 70.3 worlds and very high prize money - 200K and
above. Category B which was consists of most big regional races with
prize money pools of 60K-200K and Category C for 60K and under which
consists of local races.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: We write Approximate Tommy Rank because we do not
have the available prize money list for all historical races. Instead,
score the races using the formula described below. Then we divide races
into Category A, B and C based on manually picked thresholds.
</strong>.</p>
<p>The strength of a race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is
simply the sum of the start of the year PTO scores for athletes
participating. Shown below are the scores for women at the end of 2018.
These are the scores used for all of 2019. For example, if Daniela Ryf
were to participate in a race, she would contribute 380.38 pts to a
race. If Lucy and Daniela were to race, that race would get 380.38 +
343.64 pts accordingly.</p>

<p>Shown below is the strength distribution using our formula and prize
money for choice races in 2019. We show this to justify that our
approximate ranking score is a reasonable. However, in practice for
Tommy Rank, the prize money should be used to decide the strength of
field. The 2020 prize money distribution for some races can be found <a

<p>Shown above is the distribution of strength of field in 2019 based on
our heuristic. Based on inspection, we pick thresholds 5000 and 1500 to
divide races into Cat A, B and C. The reader might point out that we are
using the PTO scores which we claimed to be sub optimal. While that
claim is true, we are quantising the races into coarse buckets – most
ranking algorithms will produce similar quantisations. We do not expect
the PTO races to rank an elite athlete nearly 40 places lower than
expected. Later, when we introduce the much studied Luce-Plackett
ranking, we will observe that the quantisations are comparable. Finally,
this is an approximation of prize purse. So it does not really effect
the true algorithm. When the prize purse is available use that
instead.</p>

\leq 1000\)</span> i.e. Cat C races. Cat A needs the strength to be
greater than 5000 and everything else is Cat B which gets a <span
class="math inline">\(w_i=0.9\)</span>.</p>
<p>In summary the score obtained by an athlete for race <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is simply, the discount factor times
the position reward. Thus if one were to win a Cat A race, they get
25pts. A cat B race gets you <span
class="math inline">\(0.9*25=22.5\)</span> pts and finally winning a Cat
C race gets you <span class="math inline">\(0.7*25=17.5\)</span> pts.
For yearly rankings, similar to the PTO we sum the top 3 performances in
a year.</p>
<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>
<p>The biggest drawback of this method is that it is not principled in
its selection of quantisation thresholds and it uses PTO scores(though
we could also use quality scores derived in <a href="../PrimoRank/">part
III</a>). There is no theoretical justification to using the prize purse
either. We do not justify our use of Formula 1 scoring either. So when
someone does poorly, we cannot really trace it back to our assumptions
and reason about why we did poorly. <strong>We do not recommend building
such systems.</strong> Such systems look nice and simple on the outside
but always land you in trouble later.</p>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths</h3>
<p>However, the method has a few strong properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is simple and transparent.</li>
<li>It is difficult to game.</li>
<li>It encourages the best athletes to compete with each other. Knowing
you cannot get many points from smaller regional races, it promotes the
best competing against the best.</li>
<li>It allows independent races to allocate prize money and attract the
best racers. It prevents the sport from being a monopoly.</li>
<li>The method still follows the general mathematical model we
described. It’s just happens that the parameters of the model were
picked based on intuition. Specifically, the formula for strength of
field is not mathematically derived but based on prize purse. Replacing
the approximate Tommy Rank with available prize money (Tommy Rank) is a
reasonable heuristic.</li>
<li>This ranking system has parameters that can be tuned for change
different models of fairness. For example, the discount 0.9 and 0.7 were
plucked out of thin air. It is possible to align those numbers to the
populations perceived difficulty of a race. Similarly, the ratio of
points awarded to second vs third is up for debate. They should
represent the athlete populations inner value of coming second over
third.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the reader is not satisfied by such a laissez faire approach to
ranking athletes, we are on your side. In <a href="../PrimoRank/">part
III</a> we put a little more thought.</p>
