<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is an auxillary post in support of <a href="http://abiswas3.github.io/blog/EloTriathlon/">this post</a> which discusses new methods to rank triathletes. In the previous post we introduced a generic model for scoring race performances. The score for a given race was based on the finish position. That score was multiplied by a discount factor to accomodate for the strength of the field in the race. We proposed Tommy Rank, a heuristic based ranking system, based on the intuition of a field expert. In this post, we describe a more principled appraoch to calculating the strength of the field for a given race.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-issue-with-tommy-rank-or-other-heuristics">What’s the issue with Tommy Rank or other heuristics</h2>
<p>In Tommy Rank, the strength of field for a race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(r) = \sum_{a \in X_r} \frac{1}{\text{rank}(a)}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X_r\)</span> represents the set of athletes that participated in <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. The immediate consequence of such a scoring system is as follows - we are claiming the value of having the top 3 racers race in race is much greater than having athletes ranked 4-10 race in the same race. It is not clear this is immediately true. Furthermore, we have provided no empirical evidence to back this statement. **NOTE: The real version of Tommy Rank just uses available prize purse. The above formula was used because we did not have access to that data*. However, prize purse is also a heuristic. We need to back out from previous race results the strength of a certain race.</p>
<h2 id="plackett-luce">Plackett-Luce</h2>
<p>In 1975, Plackett introduced the <a href="">axioms of choice theory</a>. The axioms were an attempt to understand how humans made choices when presented with a multitude of options. A direct consequence of these axioms, was the proposal of the <a href="">Placket-Luce</a> model by Marden in 1995. He proved it to be a generalisation of the Bradley Terry model, which is underlying model for evaluating pairwise competitions like chess, scrabble, video games, college sports etc. We re-describe the model in terms of measuring the quality of a triathlete.</p>
<p>Denote the athletes by integers X={1, 2, 3, …, n}. These integer assignments are random. They do not represent the actual rank of the athlete. It is used to make the notation cleaner. WLet <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> represent the intrinsic talent of an athlete <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. We do not know this value apriori. It needs to be estimated using race results.Then the probability of of athlete <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> winning a race when competing with other athletes in set <span class="math inline">\(A_r \subseteq X\)</span> is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\text{i wins over A_r}) = \frac{\theta_i}{\sum_{a \in A_r}
\theta_a}\]</span> EQN 1</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi(i,r)\)</span> be the race result of athlete <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> for race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>NOTATION CLEAN UP NEEDED:</p>
<p>The probability of observing race results where 1 beats 2, and 2 beats 3 and 3 beats 4 … and so on is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P\Big( \pi(1) \rightarrow \pi(2) \rightarrow ... \pi(k) \Big) = 
\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{\theta_{\pi(i)}}{\theta_{\pi(i)}+ ...+ \theta_{\pi(k)}}\]</span></p>
<p>Marden (1995) points out that the above model arises from (EQN 1) if we envision the ranking process as first choosing a winner, then choosing a second-place finisher as the winner among those that remain and so on.</p>
