<h1>How to Collins Cup</h1>
<p>The extract below is quoted from the <a
href="https://stats.protriathletes.org/points">PTO Website</a>. A more
detailed explanation can be found <a
href="https://protriathletes.org/the-pto-world-rankings-explained/">here</a></p>
<p><code>Until the completion of the Collins Cup on August 28, the PTO World Rankings shall be determined by averaging the World Ranking Points earned by an athlete from the highest two of (i) any races completed between December 1, 2020 and before August 9, 2021 and (ii) the average of the Athlete’s best three races for from December 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020.</code></p>
<p>An example worksheet provided by the <a
href="https://content.protriathletes.org/content/Special-Collins-Cup-Qualification-Protocal-APRIL-FINAL.pdf">PTO</a>.
Put simply, there are two time frames <span
class="math inline">\(R1\)</span> which considers recent races and <span
class="math inline">\(R2\)</span> which considers old races. Visually
the time frame looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="pngs/timeframe.png" width="90%"></img></p>
<p>Now whover came up with these time frames must have not noticed that
they have a common intersection. Now if someone races in that
intersection, does that race go to <span
class="math inline">\(R2\)</span> bucket or the <span
class="math inline">\(R1\)</span> bucket. Depending on which bucket it
goes to, the final score changes. See example below.</p>
<h2 id="when-you-race-in-the-red-box">When you race in the red box</h2>
<p>Meet George Goodwin. (Disclaimer: I do not know Mr Goodwin, Mr
Goodwin certainly does not know me and he did not ask me to this but his
profile fits the confusion)</p>
<p>George raced an event called Challenge Daytona on December 6th, 2020.
That is in the red zone. How should we use this race to calculate his
score?</p>
<p><img src="pngs/george_goodwin.png" width="90%"></img></p>
<h3 id="assuming-r2">Assuming R2</h3>
<p>If we assume that this race is R2, then the picture above looks a
little this.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/wrong_timeframe.png" width="90%"></img></p>
<p>The average of his best 3 results in R2 is <span
class="math inline">\((96.34+ 89.88 + 88.19)/3 = 91.47\)</span></p>
<p>The collins cup score is now <span class="math inline">\((91.47 +
62.11)/2 = 76.79\)</span></p>
<h2 id="assuming-r1">Assuming R1</h2>
<p>If we assume that this race is R1, then the picture above looks a
little this.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/right_time_frame.png" width="90%"></img></p>
<p>The average of his best 3 results in R2 is <span
class="math inline">\((89.88 + 88.19 + 77.91)/3 = 85.32\)</span></p>
<p>The collins cup score is now <span class="math inline">\((85.32 +
96.34)/2 = 90.83\)</span></p>
<p>The website reports the score as</p>
<p><img src="pngs/george_score.png" width="90%"></img></p>
<p>Thus it would seem the last figure is the accurate model for dividing
time and not the one reported in the instructions.</p>
<p>Thus it would seem that the actual dates are</p>
