<strong><u>Disclaimer</u></strong>: I am not an athlete nor can I claim
to be a hardcore triathlon fan. I am not directly affected by the
outcome of different ranking strategies, financially or spiritually. My
interest in the problem is purely from an algorithmic game theory
standpoint. Ranking strategies often lead to pathological behaviours (<a
href="https://youtu.be/TM_QFmQU_VA?t=494">see</a> for an example).
Understanding and analysing the mathematical underpinnings of such
behaviour is a personal research interest. Note as these systems
represent rank actual people with feelings and were developed by a
different set of humans (also with feelings), I have tried to remain as
neutral as possible in my discourse. In the off chance someone is
offended, I apologise.

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>In 2020, the PTO deployed a system for ranking triathletes which many
perceived to be complicated and unfair<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. <a
href="https://abiswas3.github.io/sportsMaths/ProblemStatement/index.html">See</a>
for a refresher. At the heart of this ranking malarky lies a simple
question – “How do you compare the performance of two athletes who did
not race each other on the same day?”. One cannot sort two performances
by finish time as they vary across courses. The problem is not unique to
triathlon either. This question has plagued social choice theory since
the 1950s, so it’s unlikely any proposed solution will resolve all
outstanding issues. Similar measurement issues arise in marathon
running, tennis, chess, golf and many other sports. Thus, the PTO
employed a committee of athletes, who after a year of discussion and
deliberation, came up with a new system that resolves this question in
fair manner. A key motif behind doing over the old system was to
simplify how ranking points were calculated and to re-align the rankings
to better represent the athlete values.. <a
href="https://protriathletes.org/pto-world-ranking-system/">A clear
description of the new system can be found here</a> and thus there is no
need to go over the details again.</p>
<p>At this point, as far as the PTO is concerned, this ranking problem
appears solved. The athletes were affected by the rankings, and they
decided to devise a system that prioritised their interests. The people
decided for the people, and democracy won and as Bernard Shaw famously
stated – “Democracy is a device that ensures we shall be governed no
better than we deserve.” Thus this manuscript, unlike its predecessors
does not try to propose an alternate system. It simply tries to model
the consequences of such a system. The remainder of this document is
written from the perspective of an imaginary triathlete Bob, who isn’t
that great at swim, bike or run. However, much like his namesake<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, Bob will look to lie and cheat to
find ways to boost his ranking. In other words, what is the maximum
triathlon ranking Bob can get without actually investing any time in
being good at triathlon?</p>
<!-- The hope is that the search for Bob's strategies will highlight the -->
<!-- pathological tendencies of the new ranking system. It should not be -->
<!-- read as a critique of the current system. All ranking systems (even -->
<!-- provably optimal ones) lead to unavoidable social -->
<!-- situations. Typically a group of humans will look at the odds of that -->
<!-- situation arising and accept it as an unavoidable risk. Bob's attacks -->
<!-- might be shown to be improbable, and that should strengthen the trust -->
<!-- in the new system. -->
<h2 id="the-new-system">The New System</h2>
<p>From the outset it would appear that the new system considers a
diverse set of facets of a race and then weight them to compute a final
score. However, closer examination of the point system reveals that the
new system is really based around one central concept – the committees’
definition of strength of field. There are 3 ways to accumulate points
during a triathlon race, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Finishing higher up in big races</strong> – akin to how
winning the Olympic gold should matter more than winning your local park
run. The Bigness of a race is determined by the athletes, race
organisers and how much cash is up for grabs. There are five types of
races, each with a base score and a drop-off rate. Let <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> be the base score and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> be the drop off rate for a type of
race. Then the winner gets <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
points, the next athlete is <span class="math inline">\(r\%\)</span>
lower than the person ahead of them. The group scores are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diamond: (100, 2)</li>
<li>Platinum: (95, 2)</li>
<li>Gold: (90, 5)</li>
<li>Silver: (80, 8)</li>
<li>Bronze (70, 11)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Race the best to be the best</strong> – Each race has a
strength of field (SOF) score which is meant to reflect hardness to win.
The higher the SOF the harder it is to win this race. Regardless of your
final race position, if you took part in this race, you get an additive
offset of <span class="math inline">\(0.3*SOF\)</span> added to your
final score. The SOF score is just the average of the PTO rank score for
the top 5 athletes that start the race.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finishing unreasonably quickly should be
rewarded</strong> – Finish time is not a reliable metric in comparing
across different races. Wind, road surface, rain, heat, hills are some
of the miscellaneous factors that act as counterfactuals that bias time.
However, if you ask athletes, they’ll often tell you words like
<em>“That’s a really fast time for this course”</em>. So, very
believably, they have instinctive feel for what is fast or a superhuman
performance. They would like to reward an athlete for such a
performance. They do so by calculating how much faster (or slower) an
athlete went from a base time (quite similar to AIT) as a percentage. So
if the base time was 100s and I complete the race 104s. Then I went 4%
faster and for every 1% I went faster I get an additional 6 bonus points
on top of the baseline points.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally they take the score from each category and add them up with
different weights. Shown below is a screen grab from <a
href="https://www.triathlete.com/culture/news/new-2023-pto-rankings-revealed-dissected/">this
article</a> which goes over the arithmetic.</p>

alt="An illustration of how points are calcuated" />

</figure>
<!-- PS: There is a harmless arithmetic error in the [PTO Website -->
<!-- description](https://protriathletes.org/pto-world-ranking-system/) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- An athlete’s final Race Time Score is calculated by starting with the Baseline Score and adding or deducting 6 points for every 1% that they’re faster or slower than the Baseline Time. An athlete’s Race Time Score cannot fall below 0 regardless of how far behind the Baseline Time they finish a race -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- And then they work out an example: -->
<!-- ![[pngs/Screenshot 2023-02-17 at 12.12.22.png]] -->
<!-- $Base = 3:58:17$ -->
<!-- First finisher $= 3:44:40$ -->
<!-- They are faster than baseline should be  $\frac{| Base - finish|}{Base}$ but instead $\frac{| Base - finish|}{finish}= 6.06\%$. The error is harmless as everything is linear, and it shouldn't matter that much :-)   -->
<h2 id="the-weights-do-not-matter">The weights do not matter</h2>
<p>As previously stated, although the final score is a mixture of three
different features, the three features are highly correlated. This
implies that only one feature really matters – strength of field.</p>
<p>To see why Feature 1 (Tier of a race) and Feature 2 strength of field
are correlated is easy. The tiering of a race is based on prize money
and prestige, and thus the best athletes end up racing those races.</p>
<p>The figure below plots the tier on the Y-axis and the SOF on the
X-axis. It is easy to see that the two are positively correlated. For a
fixed tier, one might observe that the SOF has enormous variance (we
will get to this later) but if you do well in a high tiered race, you
will almost always do well in the SOF category as well.</p>
<p><img src="" /></p>
<p>Feature 3 is supposed to reward an athlete based on the difference
between their time and the time of the top finishers. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> represent this time difference<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The final score is calculated as
<span class="math inline">\(0.3(B + \Delta)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(B = (Tier + SOF)/2\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(Tier\)</span> is the tier points awarded to the
winner of the race. Note <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has
nothing to do with your acutal performance. <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is determined even before the race
starts.</p>
<p>Thus the final score <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
S &amp;= 0.4\times Tier + 0.3\times SOF + 0.3(B + \Delta) \\
&amp;= 0.4\times Tier + 0.3\times SOF + 0.3((Tier + SOF)/2 + \Delta) \\
&amp;= 0.4\times Tier + 0.3\times SOF + 0.15\times Tier + 0.15\times SOF
+ 0.3\times\Delta \\
&amp;= 0.55\times Tier + 0.45\times SOF + 0.3\times\Delta
\end{align}\]</span></p>
