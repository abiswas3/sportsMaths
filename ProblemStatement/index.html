<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>A friend recently introduced me to <a href="https://stats.protriathletes.org/rankings/women">World Triathlon Rankings</a>. It got me thinking about how these rankings are calculated. The Professional Triathlete Organisation (PTO) provides an explanation <a href="https://protriathletes.org/the-pto-world-rankings-explained/">here</a>. The immediate question that I had was, how do you compare athletes who never race each other on the same course. Unlike Formula 1 or the Premier League where each racer/team competes with each other across a season, long course athletes rarely compete with each other. Shown below is <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> x <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> normalised co-occurence matrix of how often the best athletes actually race each other. Here <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> depicts the top <span class="math inline">\(N=35\)</span> women professional triathletes as of May 22, 2021. The men follow a similar co-occurrence distribution.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/co-occurence.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>There were 160 half ironman or ironman races from in 2019, 2020 and 2021. A cell score of 1 would mean those 2 athletes raced all 160 races together. The figure above indicates a high score of .035 which would indicated two athletes shared a race <span class="math inline">\(ceil(0.035*160)\)</span> times out of 160 races and this is the most frequently two athletes compete against each other on the long course over 3 years. This makes intuitive sense and is unlikely to change in the future. Endurance events are physically draining. Long course athletes cannot compete at an optimal level every month. Furthermore, traveling for triathlon is an expensive ordeal. Athletes in Australia do not usually compete in the major European races. Barring a handful of races like Hawaii, Challenge Daytona and 70.3 Worlds, it is unlikely athletes will assemble for the same race. More about this later.</p>
<p>The primary blocker to figuring out how to rank professional triathletes - is to come up with a solution to compare two separate race performances on the same scale. Athletes live in different parts of the world and cannot always travel to major races. This implies that neither the strength of the field nor the number of professionals attending a race is the same every race. Shown below is a the attendance distribution of 70.3 and Ironman races across the last three years for professional womens sport.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/num_athletes_distribution.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>As discussed earlier, we observe that not a lot of professional athletes show up to every race. Next we look at the strength of field of races. The formula to compute the strength of a field for a race is slightly contrived. For a given race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Strength(r) = \sum_{a \in r} \frac{1}{rank(a)}\]</span></p>
<p>For a given race, we just sum the reciprocal of the world ranking of the athlete. For an athlete not in the top 100, we give them all a rank of 101. This implies, if an athlete is not in the top 100, they have the same impact on the strength of the field regardless of their rank. The general idea is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank">Mean Reciprocal Rank</a> used to evaluate Search Retrieval Systems.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/strength_of_field.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: I need to think this through a bit more. MRR doesn’t really apply here. Also I use the current world rankings and not the world rankings at the time of race. This doesn’t really change the shape of the distribution and important races do end up having a higher score. However, we need to think this through further.</strong></p>
<p>Using the above formula, IM Hawaii 2019, the world championship had a strength of <span class="math inline">\(2.67\)</span> wheras IM Ireland had a score of <span class="math inline">\(0.059\)</span>.</p>
<p>Such a variance in strength of field prevents us from using simple scoring systems like they use in Formula 1; where the winner of a race is awarded 25 pts, second 18 pts and so on. Most triathletes would agree that winning the world championship is more impressive than winning a regional race like IM Wisconsin. Some athletes would argue hilly courses suit them while others argue windy ones suit them. So we cannot weight performances of all races equally. If we did, we incentivise athletes to seek out the weakest fields and races that suit them. This prevents the sport from having the best compete with the best, thereby reducing triathlons value as a spectator sport.</p>
<p>Given what we have discussed, this problem is non trivial to solve. In the next section we look to understand how the current athlete scores and ranks are computed. How did the PTO navigate the issues we just discussed?</p>
<h2 id="the-current-system">The Current System</h2>
<p>For any race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, there is an expected finish time <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[r]\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{E}[r]}\)</span> be the estimate of this expectation (the PTO website calls this number AIT). We defer the discussion of how this estimate is computed. Assume it exists and is a fair number for all races <span class="math inline">\(r \in R\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the set of races. The PTO claim that this number is adjusted for courses - hilly, windy, cold etc. For now we assume this is true. We will defer the veracity of that claim for a later post.</p>
<p>Let the finish time of athlete <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> for race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(f(a,r)\)</span>. The score or world ranking points for that race for athlete <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(a, r) = 100 + (\overline{\mathbb{E}[r]} - f(a,r))/\delta\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta = 0.15\%*\overline{\mathbb{E}[r]}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In words (from the PTO website), If an athlete equals the AIT for any eligible race, they receive 100 World Ranking Points. If an athlete is faster than the AIT, they are awarded an additional World Ranking Point or fraction of a point for each .15% by which they beat the AIT – where AIT is <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{E}[r]}\)</span> in our notation.</p>
<p>See worked out example:</p>
<pre><code>-----------------------------------
2019 IM Hawaii Women AIT:  09:01:46
----------------------------------
Anne Haug finish time - 8:40:10
Lucy Charles finish time - 8:46:44

Using the formula described above, delta = 48.75899999999999

----------------------------------
Scores:
----------------------------------
Ann Haug : 100 + [1296/48.758] = 126.57
Lucy Charles: 100 + [902/48.758] = 118.49</code></pre>
<p>We verify our estimate with the reported number on the site.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/score_calc.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>The final score for an athlete is the sum of an athletes best 3 races in a year, as quoted by the <a href="https://stats.protriathletes.org/points">website</a>. The Collins cup qualifying has a slightly more complicated protocol but it is still based on points calculated of AIT and can be found <a href="http://abiswas3.github.io/blog/PTO_Scoring/">here</a></p>
<p><code>The PTO World Rankings shall be determined by the aggregate number of World Ranking Points an athlete has earned for their three best races for 2021, with the final rankings on December 31, 2021, determining the pay-out to PTO Professionals under the PTO Annual Bonus System.</code></p>
<h2 id="some-immediate-consequences-of-such-a-system">Some immediate consequences of such a system</h2>
<p>The PTO’s approach is to use AIT or an estimate of expected finish time to normalise across races. Under the current system, given a race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, to maximise one’s chances to improve their PTO rank, each athlete should try and beat the AIT of a race. Racing other athletes is secondary. Such a scheme leads to the following scenario. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code>Athelte A and B are competing for the same PTO world ranking

A and B&#39;s history of points so far  looks like the following:

A : 99, 100, 88
B : 101, 97, 86

Yearly points:
A: (99 + 100 + 88)/3 = 95.66
B: (101+97+86)/3 = 94.66

B needs to get 3 points more than A in a race to win.</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the scores so far one would assume <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are very evenly matched i.e. in all races so far, they have had similar finish times. The last race of the year should be a decider for who should take the spot they are competing for. Now they are racing a course on a really windy and rainy day. Lots of races have wind and rain variance across the years. All athletes are way off the expected finish time.</p>
<p>Everyone is suffering, but <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> manages to beat <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by a good 30 minutes. In professional Ironman, such a gap is considered to be a demolition. Intuitively, for two evenly matched athletes, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> having won the decider decisively, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> should get the higher spot. They raced 4 times, A won twice marginally, B won once marginally and once decisively.</p>
<p>However based on the PTO scoring system, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> does not usurp <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Despite <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> winning the race, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> having a terrible race – the race conditions meant that all athetes were way off the AIT. Thus the maximum points to be gained from this race is much lower than their historical scores. The PTO takes only the top 3 races.</p>
<p>At this point the reader might be wondering if such a situation really happens? Can you win a race and still get really low race points? The answer is YES! It happens all the time. Shown below is the distribution of the race winners points for long serving races. For races that have been organised annually for at least 5 years in a row, we examine the distribution of winner points.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/winner_pts.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>On the Y axis is the race points won by the women’s winner of the race. On the X axis are different popular races. Multiple races like IM-UK, have had winners vary from the scores 20 to 80 over a span of 5 years or more. On the contrary, the winner at Hawaii has consistenly outdone the expected finish time. It also appears that AIT points prefer certain courses like Roth over courses like IM UK. The reader might infer that this is because Roth usually has a stronger field. However, we show later in this document that, this is not the case. Intuitively, the above formula for scoring does not take into account the strength of field. (<strong>NOTE: The AIT computation might indirectly, but as we show later it is not really represented in the data)</strong>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the score obtained by an athlete is based purely on the AIT time. Winning a race with a very strong field gives you no advantage in your world rankings. The only incentive to be ranked higher is to beat the predicted time. Also so far we have ignored, how accurate this predicted time actually is. From the figure above, it would seem it is not very good at predicting the race winner time. Ideally the race winner should on average be close to 100 pts. However, when we look at the distribution of winner finish times in 2018 and 2019, it seems that AIT overestimates athlete performance consistently. Shown below is the winner pts distribution for the women’s pro field across all races that had an AIT in 2018 and 2019</p>
<p><img src="pngs/winner_dist_2019.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p><img src="pngs/winner_dist_2018.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>It seems that on average the winner of pro race in the women’s field receives 80 points, thereby missing the expected time for a race most of the time. <strong>Important: </strong>Despite showing that the current system has very high variance, our results so far do not indicate the current system is dysfunctional. All we have shown that under certain circumstances, the current system might disadvantage athletes. We are yet to show that points system has actually hurt athlete rankings in practice or quantify how likely the sytem might screw someone over. We do this next.</p>
<h3 id="i-beat-the-best-athletes-and-was-worse-off-for-it">I beat the best athletes and was worse off for it</h3>
<p>In this section we show how the avg points awarded to the top 3 participants vary with the strength of the field. We use the formula defined above. While it is not callibrated properly, it is still monotonic with perceived strength of field and serves to illustrate why the current system could be problematic. The blocks shown in red, are races where racers achieved high scores while winning in a weaker field compared to the green box. The green box race winners scored equal if not lower points while beating much stiffer competition.</p>
<p>As qualitative reference for understanding these numbers we reference to the two races below. We let the readers decide which race was more stacked, and which one should regarded more.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/screwy_ness.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>The reader might notice that at the extreme right there are few scatter points flying around. Those represent the world championships and challenge daytona. Really big races rarely have low scores. This is natural. Assume the probability of an elite top 20 athlete having a misfire is <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. The probability all of them misfire is <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^{20}\)</span>. Say <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is very high like <span class="math inline">\(30\%\)</span> i.e an elite athlete bonks in 3 out of 10 races, the probability that we still see a high score is <span class="math inline">\(99.99\%\)</span>. This is desirable, we want to reward athletes winning stacked races. The issue is on the other end. There are plenty of races with much weaker fields that where winning is rewarded on the same scale as winning the bigger races.</p>
<p>Let us look at the case of Holly Lawrence. In 2019, Holly was ranked 5th in the world and in that entire year she had won every race barring two. In the two she had not won, she had lost to only Daniela Ryf - the world number 1. In fact she had beaten the following athletes ranked above her.</p>
<pre><code>4 Sarah Crowley 1.0
3 Anne Haug 1.0
2 Lucy Charles-Barclay 1.0</code></pre>
<p>So in a year where Holly had beaten all athletes ranked above her excepting Daniela, she still got ranked 5th. Why? It is because Lucy, Anne and Sarah ran some other race Holly did not race and beat the AIT by a bigger margin. Athletes are not aware of the AIT before a race, so they have no idea if they can beat it.</p>
<h2 id="a-slight-detour-understanding-the-incentives-of-the-sport">A slight detour: Understanding the incentives of the sport</h2>
<p>Any ranking system is inherently transitive. If you rank A, B and C in ascending order. It says on average A would best B and B would best C, thereby indicating A would best C by the transitive property.</p>
<p>Before we try and design/evaluate a system that pits athletes against each other, it is important to understand how athletes think and what they value in the sport. <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not an athlete. This is an attempt at summarising my understanding of how professionals race. This information is gathered through face to face conversations, viewing official races and race interviews. It appears that for an elite athlete, there is one primary goal – to qualify for and win the world championship. For the Ironman distance, this race is Kona. The 70.3 has an annual world championship every year as well. Winning the aforementioned long course races is considered the pinnacle of sporting achievement. Throughout the rest of the season the focus of the athletes is to get a spot in one of these races. Once a spot is secured, the focus shifts to ensuring a peak performance in Kona. Whether this assumption is true or not can be debated by people who actually race for a living. It should be noted that the system before 2017 was based on points accumulated during a season. Ironman spcifically went away from that system to prevent athletes from burning out before the big race. For now assume my assumptions hold, and let us understand how the current system is misaligned with how athletes race. After building this intuition through qualitative analysis, we will look at the empirical comparison of top 5 athletes at kona and end of the year world rankings.</p>
<p>We first begin with how Kona qualification works.There are plenty of <a href="https://www.triathlete.com/culture/news/the-good-and-the-bad-of-the-new-ironman-world-championship-pro-qualifying-system/">blog posts</a> out there describing how this works. Some athletes do not need to qualify for Kona:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last years winner of Kona.</li>
<li>Last years Kona podium athletes.</li>
<li>Last years 70.3 winner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>However, these athletes must still complete a “validating” race, where they complete the distance within the racing year.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s pause and think about what the implications of that one statement are. The above list of athletes are elite - they have won the bloody thing last year. Rankings are re-done every year. So in this new year, these athletes just have to finish some race, to make sure they can go to Kona again. There is no incentive to win or post a fast time. Why bother? There might be risk of injury. Going to a race has a lot of faff to it. However in this race they will be awarded (or not awarded) points. It might be still be considered for computing rankings. One could argue that the PTO only uses the top 3 races in a year. So these races won’t be considered. Such a statement is only true if an elite athlete races a lot more than 3 times a year. We will look into how often professional athletes race in a later section.</p>
<p>Now for those who did not get an automatic slot, we copy this excerpt from a post describing qualifying</p>
<p><code>For Kona qualifying, there is one slot per gender at most races, two at regional championships, plus extra “floating slots” allocated to specific races, usually regional champions or bigger races Ironman chooses. (You can see the full pro calendar with its allocations) This is where it gets a little confusing. The two floating slots will either be split evenly between men and women or will both go to one gender, based on how many men and women are on the start line that day. There are 100 slots total.</code></p>
<p>There appears to be some controversy regarding how floating slots are assigned but it is beyond the scope of this document. The big takeway from the quoted text is the following – to get to Kona you must win a race and that gets you to the championship. Nowhere does it say, you are better off if you go faster. Under the current ranking system, one is always encouraged to go faster. One could argue, that going fast and winning are extremely correlated. Does that not equate to the same thing? The short answer is “yes but not really”. Athletes do not always need to push themselves to the maximum in every race. Let’s consider the following example:</p>
<p>Shown below are the results for Ironman Tulsa on May 23rd, 2021.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/tulsa_results.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>Before the race started, the following athletes were already Kona qualified. There were two spots available for qualification in this race.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daniela Ryf</li>
<li>Kat Matthews</li>
<li>Sky Moensch</li>
<li>Heather Jackson</li>
<li>Sarah Crowley</li>
<li>Ruth Astle</li>
<li>Meredith Kessler</li>
</ul>
<p>Just Gurutze Frades Larralde, Kimberley Morrison and Tara Grosvenor were not qualified going in. Kimberley Morrison was awarded a Kona Spot for this race. She came off the bike in second place but her real incentive was to not be crossed by more than 1 athlete without a Kona Qualification spot. That was the safer strategy given the goal of the sport and knowing a lot can go wrong in the marathon leg of an ironman. Similarly Daniela Ryf came out nearly 20 minutes ahead on the bike. She does not need to run the marathon at her maximum effort to secure podium. Athletes race each other. They swim/bike/run as fast as they need to secure podium. Should their efforts be judged against some arbitrary predefined time for completion? Post race, Kat Matthews (I cannot find a link to the interview), declared her goal was Kona from here on. She would not be racing any long course events from here on. She might do some 70.3 races to stay in shape.</p>
<p>At this point we have hopefully convinced you that most athletes do not need to race each race to their fullest ability and that most athletes want to peak for Kona. What this implies is, that even the strategy of best 3 races in a year is likely sub optimal. This makes the problem of ranking triathletes even harder. Not only do they not compete against each other often; even when they do - they might have different incentives.</p>
<p>In the next section, we look at how often athletes race once qualification is secured.</p>
<h3 id="do-world-ranking-represent-kona-behaviour">Do world ranking represent Kona behaviour</h3>
<p>Kona is the one race the best athletes race each other on the same course with the same incentives - TO WIN.</p>
<p>Shown below are the end of they year world rankings for the top 5 men athletes at Kona. On inspection it might not look too bad. It would seem like the world rankings system is pretty good at picking the top 3 athletes. However, this is an artifact of having two very dominant champions over a long time i.e. Jan Frodeno and Sebastien Kienle. When you have a champion like Jan who is so dominant, the ranking system does not matter. Whatever the sytem, they usually always win. As an exercise we leave the reader to look up how positions 5-10 align with world rankings to convince themselves.</p>

<p>Once again it might not look egregious. Both tables have some outliers or surprises. The women’s fielf has had dominant champions in Daniela Ryf, Lucy Charles, Anne Haug and Mirinda Carfrae. In sport whenever you have dominant champions, the ranking sytem for those athletes becomes redundant. They come out on top on with all systems. The more interesting distribution are the athletes ranked 5-15 in both genders. It remains a philosophical question how much the championship should dictate world rankings. Under the current system, it has the same weight as all other races. That seems unfair given not all races have the same field nor the same incentives. We could also base the entire ranking off of Kona performance, which seems unfair as well. Someone who has been consistent all year could have an off day. Should their entire career ranking depend on one race?</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-better-system-how-can-we-evaluate-its-fairness">Is there a better system? How can we evaluate its fairness?</h2>
<h3 id="what-works-for-the-current-system">What works for the current system</h3>
<p>Before discussing alternate rankings we would like to point out some strengths of the current system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is quite simple. If we assume the AIT is a fair time, then the scoring is deterministic and interpretable. This is a very important feature of ranking systems. Fans and athletes crave simplicity.</p></li>
<li><p>Given that the AIT is unknown before race time it is actually quite hard to manipulate. An athlete may try to enter a weaker field and win it, but end up having a lower win score anway. They might succeed at a high score also. There seems to be no easy way to tell from the winner distributions. Some could view this as a con as well. How can an athlete strategise, how they move up in rankings if they do not know at all.</p></li>
<li>One of the biggest strengths the current system is that prevents lower ranked athletes from taking advantage of a bonk. The world of ELO i.e. chess, scrabble, college football, major league baseball is based on head to head to battles. So if a much weaker team/player were to beat a much stronger player their ranking improves dramatically. If Wigan were to beat Manchester United, it’s a big deal. If Manchester United were to beat Wigan, people would consider it as standard. This makes a lot of sense in a sport that is actually pairwise head to head. However, in triathlon athletes race a field of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> athletes. If we artificially create <span class="math inline">\({n \choose x}\)</span> pairings out of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plyaers, this system could go horribly wrong. Consider the example where Daniel Ryf had an off day in Kona
<ol start="2019" type="1">
<li>Lower ranked athletes who had a normal race were able to beat her because she performed really poorly, not because they beat her on a good day. Now should athletes benefit from not having an above average performance just because someone ranked really high had a bad performance? This is where Triathlon differs from all head to head ranking systems. In classic head to head systems, we can say with high confidence the other persons peformance caused the top ranked athlete to fail. However we cannot say that in triathlon. Thus having athletes race against the clock is a reliable around.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Finally, despite critiquing the scoring for most of the document, this is a reasonable baseline. The problem of ranking athletes that do not race each other frequently is a hard maths problem. In the subsequent series, we will go through the historical relevance of this problem. Scientists have been trying for over a 100 years.</p></li>

<p>If you have reached this far, we have hopefully convinced you why there is a need for a fairer sysystem of scoring. In the next part of this series, we discuss alternate methods of evaluation. Surprisingly, the world of chess and video games have already established solutions to some of the problems discssued above. We modify the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo</a> rating and Microsoft XBox’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">True Skill</a>.</p>
<p>So far the scoring is based on an expected finish time. We assume athletes would like some of the following traits in their scoring system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A race won in a really strong field should count more than a race won in a weaker field. Athletes race each other. People work together on the bike, sit on feet in the swim and employ different run strategies. Some athletes have a good kick. Others put the hammer down early. These strategies are based on the course and the field, not the predicted time that’s decided beforehand.</p></li>
<li><p>There should be no course bias. Certain courses should not give you more points than other independent of the field strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Scoring should be memoryless i.e. every year we reset the scores. You don’t get to rest on your laurels for too long.</p></li>
<li><p>Probably some more??</p></li>
