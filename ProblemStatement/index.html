<p><strong><u>One very important disclaimer</u></strong>: I am not an
athlete nor can I claim to be a hardcore fan. I am not affected by the
outcome of different ranking strategies, financially or spiritually. If
I use an athlete as an example, I do not actually know the athlete – I
am going just by the numbers. I have tried to remain as neutral as
possible, but in the off chance someone is offended, I apologise. The
same goes for the original creators of PTO ranking. I do not think I
could write this post without them downloading all race results and
putting it one place for me to download. It’s harder to build something
from scratch than to improve one tiny piece of it. The good news is, I
have no followers on any social media platform, thus this post will
never go viral. Your reputation is safe. I also make a lot mistakes in
spelling, grammar and code and sometimes prove things incorrectly– so do
not trust everything I say. I believe that the people affected in
triathlon i.e. those with skin in the game should really decide what
behaviour should be rewarded in triathlon.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="part-i---where-do-triathlon-rankings-come-from">Part I - Where
do Triathlon rankings come from ?</h1>
<p>A friend recently introduced me to <a
href="https://stats.protriathletes.org/rankings/women">World Triathlon
Rankings</a>. It got me thinking about how these rankings are
calculated. The Professional Triathlete Organisation (PTO) provides an
explanation <a
href="https://protriathletes.org/the-pto-world-rankings-explained/">here</a>.
The immediate question that I had was, how do you compare athletes who
never race each other on the same course. Unlike Formula 1 or the
Premier League where each racer/team competes with each other across a
season, long course athletes rarely compete with each other. Shown below
is <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> x <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> normalised co-occurence matrix of how
often the best athletes actually race each other. Here <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> depicts the top <span
class="math inline">\(N=35\)</span> women professional triathletes as of
May 22, 2021. The men follow a similar co-occurrence distribution.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/co-occurence.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>There were 160 half iron-man or iron-man races from in 2019, 2020 and
2021. A cell score of 1 would mean those 2 athletes raced all 160 races
together. The figure above indicates a high score of .035 which would
indicated two athletes shared a race about <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> times out of 160 races and this is the
most frequently two athletes compete against each other on the long
course over 3 years. This makes intuitive sense and is unlikely to
change in the future. Endurance events are physically draining. Long
course athletes cannot compete at an optimal level every month.
Furthermore, travelling for triathlon is an expensive ordeal. Athletes
in Australia do not usually compete in the major European races. Barring
a handful of races like Hawaii, Challenge Daytona and 70.3 Worlds, it is
unlikely athletes will assemble for the same race. More about this
later.</p>
<p><strong>The primary blocker to figuring out how to rank professional
triathletes - is to come up with a solution to compare two separate race
performances on the same scale.</strong> If this problem did not exist,
this problem would not be hard nor controversial. Athletes live in
different parts of the world and cannot always travel to major races.
This implies that neither the strength of the field nor the number of
professionals attending a race is the same every race. Shown below is a
the attendance distribution of 70.3 and Ironman races across the last
three years for professional womens sport.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/num_athletes_distribution.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>As discussed earlier, we observe that not a lot of professional
athletes show up to every race. Next we look at the strength of field of
races. The formula to compute the strength of a field for a race is
slightly contrived. For a given race <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Strength(r) = \sum_{a \in r}
\frac{1}{rank(a)}\]</span></p>
<p>For a given race, we just sum the reciprocal of the world ranking of
the athlete. For an athlete not in the top 100, we give them all a rank
of 101. This implies, if an athlete is not in the top 100, they have the
same impact on the strength of the field regardless of their rank. The
general idea is borrowed from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank">Mean
Reciprocal Rank</a> used to evaluate Search Retrieval Systems.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/strength_of_field.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: I need to think this through a bit more. MRR doesn’t
really apply here. Also I use the current world rankings and not the
world rankings at the time of race. This doesn’t really change the shape
of the distribution and important races do end up having a higher score.
However, we need to think this through further.</strong></p>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Update 2022-02-14</strong>: The above formula is just a
heuristic. It has no theoretical justification. MRR while looks similar,
denotes something completely different. A better way to capture the
strength of the field is to use a sum of estimated quality scores as
described in <a href="../PrimoRank/">part III</a>.</p>
<p>Though not principled, this heuristic succeeds in sending the right
message about an alteady well known representation of strengths of
fields. <strong>They are not evenly distributed.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Using the above formula, IM Hawaii 2019, the world championship had a
strength of <span class="math inline">\(2.67\)</span> wheras IM Ireland
had a score of <span class="math inline">\(0.059\)</span>.</p>
<p>Such a variance in strength of field prevents us from using simple
scoring systems like they use in Formula 1; where the winner of a race
is awarded 25 pts, second 18 pts and so on. Most triathletes would agree
that winning the world championship is more impressive than winning a
regional race like IM Wisconsin. Some athletes would argue hilly courses
suit them while others argue windy ones suit them. So we cannot weight
performances of all races equally. If we did, we incentivise athletes to
seek out the weakest fields and races that suit them. This prevents the
sport from having the best compete with the best, thereby reducing
triathlons value as a spectator sport.</p>
<p>Given what we have discussed, this problem is non trivial to solve.
In the next section we look to understand how the current athlete scores
and ranks are computed. How did the PTO navigate the issues we just
discussed?</p>
<h2 id="the-current-system">The Current System</h2>
<p>For any race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, there is an
expected finish time <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[r]\)</span>.
Let <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{E}[r]}\)</span> be the
estimate of this expectation (the PTO website calls this number AIT). We
defer the discussion of how this estimate is computed. Assume it exists
and is a fair number for all races <span class="math inline">\(r \in
R\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the set of
races. The PTO claim that this number is adjusted for courses - hilly,
windy, cold etc. For now we assume this is true. We will defer the
veracity of that claim for a later post.</p>
<p>Let the finish time of athlete <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
for race <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> be <span
class="math inline">\(f(a,r)\)</span>. The score or world ranking points
for that race for athlete <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is
defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(a, r) = 100 +
(\overline{\mathbb{E}[r]} - f(a,r))/\delta\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\delta =
0.15\%*\overline{\mathbb{E}[r]}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In words (from the PTO website), If an athlete equals the AIT for any
eligible race, they receive 100 World Ranking Points. If an athlete is
faster than the AIT, they are awarded an additional World Ranking Point
or fraction of a point for each .15% by which they beat the AIT – where
AIT is <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{E}[r]}\)</span> in
our notation.</p>
<p>See worked out example:</p>
<pre><code>-----------------------------------
2019 IM Hawaii Women AIT:  09:01:46
----------------------------------
Anne Haug finish time - 8:40:10
Lucy Charles finish time - 8:46:44

Using the formula described above, delta = 48.75899999999999

----------------------------------
Scores:
----------------------------------
Ann Haug : 100 + [1296/48.758] = 126.57
Lucy Charles: 100 + [902/48.758] = 118.49</code></pre>
<p>We verify our estimate with the reported number on the site.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/score_calc.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>The final score for an athlete is the sum of an athletes best 3 races
in a year, as quoted by the <a
href="https://stats.protriathletes.org/points">website</a>. The Collins
cup qualifying has a slightly more complicated protocol but it is still
based on points calculated of AIT and can be found <a
href="./PTO_scoring/">here</a></p>
<p><code>The PTO World Rankings shall be determined by the aggregate number of World Ranking Points an athlete has earned for their three best races for 2021, with the final rankings on December 31, 2021, determining the pay-out to PTO Professionals under the PTO Annual Bonus System.</code></p>
<h2 id="some-immediate-consequences-of-such-a-system">Some immediate
consequences of such a system</h2>
<p>The PTO’s approach is to use AIT or an estimate of expected finish
time to normalise across races. Under the current system, given a race
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, to maximise one’s chances to
improve their PTO rank, each athlete should try and beat the AIT of a
race. Racing other athletes is secondary. Such a scheme leads to the
following scenario. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code>Athelte A and B are competing for the same PTO world ranking

A and B&#39;s history of points so far  looks like the following:

A : 99, 100, 88
B : 101, 97, 86

Yearly points:
A: (99 + 100 + 88)/3 = 95.66
B: (101+97+86)/3 = 94.66

B needs to get 3 points more than A in a race to win.</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the scores so far one would assume <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are very evenly matched i.e. in all
races so far, they have had similar finish times. The last race of the
year should be a decider for who should take the spot they are competing
for. Now they are racing a course on a really windy and rainy day. Lots
of races have wind and rain variance across the years. All athletes are
way off the expected finish time.</p>
<p>Everyone is suffering, but <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
manages to beat <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by a good 30
minutes. In professional Ironman, such a gap is considered to be a
demolition. Intuitively, for two evenly matched athletes, <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> having won the decider decisively,
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> should get the higher spot. They
raced 4 times, A won twice marginally, B won once marginally and once
decisively.</p>
<p>However based on the PTO scoring system, <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> does not usurp <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Despite <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> winning the race, and <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> having a terrible race – the race
conditions meant that all athetes were way off the AIT. Thus the maximum
points to be gained from this race is much lower than their historical
scores. The PTO takes only the top 3 races.</p>
<h3 id="but-does-such-a-thing-actually-happen">But does such a thing
actually happen?</h3>
<p>At this point the reader might be wondering if such a situation
really happens? Can you win a race and still get really low race points?
The answer is YES! It happens all the time. Shown below is the
distribution of the race winners points for long serving races. For
races that have been organised annually for at least 5 years in a row,
we examine the distribution of winner points.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/winner_pts.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>On the Y axis is the race points won by the women’s winner of the
race. On the X axis are different popular races. Multiple races like
IM-UK, have had winners vary from the scores 20 to 80 over a span of 5
years or more. On the contrary, the winner at Hawaii has consistenly
outdone the expected finish time. It also appears that AIT points prefer
certain courses like Roth over courses like IM UK. Or in other words,
you are always better off racing Roth over IM UK, regardless (almost) of
where you finish. The reader might infer that this is because Roth
usually has a stronger field. However, we show later in this document
that, this is not the case. Intuitively, the above formula for scoring
does not take into account the strength of field. (<strong>NOTE: The AIT
computation might indirectly, but as we show later it is not really
represented in the data)</strong>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the score obtained by an athlete is based
purely on the AIT time. Winning a race with a very strong field gives
you no advantage in your world rankings. The only incentive to be ranked
higher is to beat the predicted time. Also so far we have ignored, how
accurate this predicted time actually is. From the figure above, it
would seem it is not very good at predicting the race winner time.
Ideally the race winner should on average be close to 100 pts. However,
when we look at the distribution of winner finish times in 2018 and
2019, it seems that AIT overestimates athlete performance consistently.
Shown below is the winner pts distribution for the women’s pro field
across all races that had an AIT in 2018 and 2019</p>
<p><img src="pngs/winner_dist_2019.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p><img src="pngs/winner_dist_2018.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>It seems that on average the winner of pro race in the women’s field
receives 80 points, thereby missing the expected time for a race most of
the time. <strong>Important: </strong>Despite showing that the current
system has very high variance, our results so far do not indicate the
current system is dysfunctional. All we have shown that under certain
circumstances, the current system might disadvantage certain athletes by
down weighting certain courses. We are yet to show that points system
has actually hurt athlete rankings in practice or quantify how likely
the system might screw someone over. We do this next.</p>
<h3 id="i-beat-the-best-athletes-and-was-worse-off-for-it">I beat the
best athletes and was worse off for it</h3>
<p>In this section we show how the avg points awarded to the top 3
participants vary with the strength of the field. We use the formula
defined above. While it is not callibrated properly, it is still
monotonic with perceived strength of field and serves to illustrate why
the current system could be problematic. The blocks shown in red, are
races where racers achieved high scores while winning in a weaker field
compared to the green box. The green box race winners scored equal if
not lower points while beating much stiffer competition.</p>
<p>As qualitative reference for understanding these numbers we reference
to the two races below. We let the readers decide which race was more
stacked, and which one should regarded more.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/screwy_ness.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>The reader might notice that at the extreme right there are few
scatter points flying around. Those represent the world championships
and challenge daytona. Really big races rarely have low scores. This is
natural. Assume the probability of an elite top 20 athlete having a
misfire is <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. The
probability all of them misfire is <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon^{20}\)</span>. Say <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is very high like <span
class="math inline">\(30\%\)</span> i.e an elite athlete bonks in 3 out
of 10 races, the probability that we still see a high score is <span
class="math inline">\(99.99\%\)</span>. This is desirable, we want to
reward athletes winning stacked races. The issue is on the other end.
There are plenty of races with much weaker fields that where winning is
rewarded on the same scale as winning the bigger races.</p>
<p>Let us look at the case of Holly Lawrence. In 2019, Holly was ranked
5th in the world and in that entire year she had won every race barring
two. In the two she had not won, she had lost to only Daniela Ryf - the
world number 1. In fact she had beaten the following athletes ranked
above her.</p>
<pre><code>4 Sarah Crowley 1.0
3 Anne Haug 1.0
2 Lucy Charles-Barclay 1.0</code></pre>
<p>So in a year where Holly had beaten all athletes ranked above her
excepting Daniela, she still got ranked 5th. Why? It is because Lucy,
Anne and Sarah ran some other race Holly did not race and beat the AIT
by a bigger margin. Athletes are not aware of the AIT before a race, so
they have no idea if they can beat it.</p>
<p>Eventually in <a href="../PrimoRank/">part III</a> of this series we
show Holly would have gotten a better rank under our model
assumptions.</p>
<p>Before we go into further disadvantages, we describe to the reader
some education pointers we picked up while talking to athletes.</p>
<h2 id="a-slight-detour-understanding-the-incentives-of-the-sport">A
slight detour: Understanding the incentives of the sport</h2>
<p>Any ranking system is inherently transitive. If you rank A, B and C
in ascending order. It says on average A would best B and B would best
C, thereby indicating A would best C by the transitive property.</p>
<p>Before we try and design/evaluate a system that pits athletes against
each other, it is important to understand how athletes think and what
they value in the sport. <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not an
athlete. This is an attempt at summarising my understanding of how
professionals race. This information is gathered through face to face
conversations, viewing official races and race interviews. It appears
that for an elite athlete, there is one primary goal – to qualify for
and win the world championship. For the Ironman distance, this race is
Kona. The 70.3 has an annual world championship every year as well.
Winning the aforementioned long course races is considered the pinnacle
of sporting achievement. Throughout the rest of the season the focus of
the athletes is to get a spot in one of these races. Once a spot is
secured, the focus shifts to ensuring a peak performance in Kona.
Whether this assumption is true or not can be debated by people who
actually race for a living. It should be noted that the system before
2017 was based on points accumulated during a season. Ironman
spcifically went away from that system to prevent athletes from burning
out before the big race. For now assume my assumptions hold, and let us
understand how the current system is misaligned with how athletes race.
After building this intuition through qualitative analysis, we will look
at the empirical comparison of top 5 athletes at kona and end of the
year world rankings.</p>
<p>We first begin with how Kona qualification works.There are plenty of
<a
href="https://www.triathlete.com/culture/news/the-good-and-the-bad-of-the-new-ironman-world-championship-pro-qualifying-system/">blog
posts</a> out there describing how this works. Some athletes do not need
to qualify for Kona:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last years winner of Kona.</li>
<li>Last years Kona podium athletes.</li>
<li>Last years 70.3 winner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>However, these athletes must still complete a “validating”
race, where they complete the distance within the racing
year.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s pause and think about what the implications of that one
statement are. The above list of athletes are elite - they have won the
bloody thing last year. Rankings are re-done every year. So in this new
year, these athletes just have to finish some race, to make sure they
can go to Kona again. There is no incentive to win or post a fast time.
Why bother? There might be risk of injury. Going to a race has a lot of
faff to it. However in this race they will be awarded (or not awarded)
points. It might be still be considered for computing rankings. One
could argue that the PTO only uses the top 3 races in a year. So these
races won’t be considered. Such a statement is only true if an elite
athlete races a lot more than 3 times a year. We will look into how
often professional athletes race in a later section.</p>
<p>Now for those who did not get an automatic slot, we copy this excerpt
from a post describing qualifying</p>
<p><code>For Kona qualifying, there is one slot per gender at most races, two at regional championships, plus extra “floating slots” allocated to specific races, usually regional champions or bigger races Ironman chooses. (You can see the full pro calendar with its allocations) This is where it gets a little confusing. The two floating slots will either be split evenly between men and women or will both go to one gender, based on how many men and women are on the start line that day. There are 100 slots total.</code></p>
<p>There appears to be some controversy regarding how floating slots are
assigned but it is beyond the scope of this document. The big takeway
from the quoted text is the following – to get to Kona you must win a
race and that gets you to the championship. Nowhere does it say, you are
better off if you go faster. Under the current ranking system, one is
always encouraged to go faster. One could argue, that going fast and
winning are extremely correlated. Does that not equate to the same
thing? The short answer is “yes but not really”. Athletes do not always
need to push themselves to the maximum in every race. Let’s consider the
following example:</p>
<p>Shown below are the results for Ironman Tulsa on May 23rd, 2021.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/tulsa_results.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>Before the race started, the following athletes were already Kona
qualified. There were two spots available for qualification in this
race.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daniela Ryf</li>
<li>Kat Matthews</li>
<li>Sky Moensch</li>
<li>Heather Jackson</li>
<li>Sarah Crowley</li>
<li>Ruth Astle</li>
<li>Meredith Kessler</li>
</ul>
<p>Just Gurutze Frades Larralde, Kimberley Morrison and Tara Grosvenor
were not qualified going in. Kimberley Morrison was awarded a Kona Spot
for this race. She came off the bike in second place but her real
incentive was to not be crossed by more than 1 athlete without a Kona
Qualification spot. That was the safer strategy given the goal of the
sport and knowing a lot can go wrong in the marathon leg of an ironman.
Similarly Daniela Ryf came out nearly 20 minutes ahead on the bike. She
does not need to run the marathon at her maximum effort to secure
podium. Athletes race each other. They swim/bike/run as fast as they
need to secure podium. Should their efforts be judged against some
arbitrary predefined time for completion? Post race, Kat Matthews (I
cannot find a link to the interview), declared her goal was Kona from
here on. She would not be racing any long course events from here on.
She might do some 70.3 races to stay in shape.</p>
<p>At this point we have hopefully convinced you that most athletes do
not need to race each race to their fullest ability and that most
athletes want to peak for Kona. What this implies is, that even the
strategy of best 3 races in a year is likely sub optimal. This makes the
problem of ranking triathletes even harder. Not only do they not compete
against each other often; even when they do - they might have different
incentives.</p>
<p>In the next section, we look at how often athletes race once
qualification is secured.</p>
<h3 id="do-world-ranking-represent-kona-behaviour">Do world ranking
represent Kona behaviour</h3>
<p>Kona (or 70.3 Worlds) is the one race the best athletes race each
other on the same course with the same incentives - TO WIN.</p>
<p>Shown below are the end of they year world rankings for the top 5 men
athletes at Kona. On inspection it might not look too bad. It would seem
like the world rankings system is pretty good at picking the top 3
athletes. However, this is an artefact of having two very dominant
champions over a long time i.e. Jan Frodeno and Sebastien Kienle were
very dominant. When you have a champion like Jan who is so dominant, the
ranking system does not matter. Whatever the sytem, they usually always
win. As an exercise we leave the reader to look up how positions 5-10
align with world rankings to convince themselves.</p>

<p>Once again it might not look egregious. Both tables have some
outliers or surprises. The women’s field has had dominant champions in
Daniela Ryf, Lucy Charles, Anne Haug and Mirinda Carfrae. In sport
whenever you have dominant champions, the ranking system for those
athletes becomes redundant. They come out on top on with all systems.
The more interesting distribution are the athletes ranked 5-15 in both
genders.</p>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Update: 2021-02-14</strong>: For those that try the exercise,
we show in <a href="../PrimoRank/">Part III</a> that these rankings do
not fairly account for Kona. Refer to the Carrie Lester case study.</p>
</div>
<p>It remains a philosophical question how much the championship should
dictate world rankings. Under the current system, it has the same weight
as all other races. That seems unfair given not all races have the same
field nor the same incentives. We could also base the entire ranking off
of Kona performance, which seems unfair as well. Someone who has been
consistent all year could have an off day. Should their entire career
ranking depend on one race?</p>
<h2 id="what-works-for-the-current-system">What works for the current
system</h2>
<p>Before discussing alternate rankings we would like to point out some
biases of the current system. Some are positive and some are negative
like any ranking system.</p>
<h3 id="its-quite-simple">It’s quite simple</h3>
<p>The controversy is regarding how they came up with AIT. If we assume
the AIT is a fair time, then the scoring is deterministic and
interpretable. This is a very important feature of ranking systems. Fans
and athletes crave simplicity. We should try and remember this at all
points of this series.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-difficult-to-game">It is difficult to game</h3>
<p>One of the strongest attributes of the current system is that it is
impossible for athletes to game. Given that nobody knows before a race
how many points can be gained from a race, it is impossible for athletes
to cherry pick races. It just so happens that some races give athletes
an unfair advantage. However there is no easy way for an athlete to know
this before hand and game the system.</p>
<h3 id="drop-outliers">Drop Outliers</h3>
<p>The scoring system only takes the top 3 races for an athlete. While
there has been no theoretical justification as to why the number 3 was
picked; the community seems to have accepted the number as fair. By only
taking the top 3 races, it allows athletes to take risks in races and
not fear blowing up. This also implies that we do not reward
consistency. As an athlete you are always incentivised to put all your
chips in the pot and go for it. If you blow up, we will just drop this
race from the ranking. As long as you do not blow up all the time, a bad
performance does not hurt your score. This is unique to triathlon to the
best of our knowledge. In this universe a bad performance does not hurt
you. It is simply like it did not even exist. You are measured only by
your good performances. Not many ranking systems in the wild employ this
strategy. Imagine having a day job where we ignore your screw ups? As a
direct consequence of such a system, Daniela’s Kona 2019 performance or
Jan’s 2017 Kona performance do not affect their scores at all. It
remains a philosophical question for the people in the sport to decide
whether it should or not.</p>
<h3
id="triathlon-is-not-really-a-head-to-head-sport-but-it-kinda-is">Triathlon
is not really a head to head sport but it kinda is</h3>
<p>In order to score a performance, the current system pits an athlete
against the clock and not against each other. We have already argued
that pitting athletes against the clock is not meaningful, but by not
pitting them against each other; the current system circumnavigates the
problem of disjoint universes (or sparsity) i.e. athletes do not race
each other often – so there is no way to compare them directly. Someone
with a little background in ranking might argue that this problem exists
in Chess, American College Football, Scrabble, Video Games, Pro Tennis
and many other sports. They get around it using modifications of the
extremely well studied <a
href="http://abiswas3.github.io/blog/eloExplained/">ELO</a>. All of the
above sports navigate the problem of sparsity by making the assumption
of probabilistic transitivity, which states – if A beats B with high
probability and B beats C with high probability, then A also beats C
with high probability. This is not untrue of triathlon, however such a
model also makes a assumption which does not hold true for triathlon.
The assumption is as follows: Assume two players A and B play a Tennis
match against each other. A is the highest ranked player in the world, B
is a new player with provisional rankings. If B were to beat A, A’s loss
on that day can be attributed to B’s skill on that day being higher than
B’s expected skill. If both A and B had performed to their expected
skill level, A should have won. Given this assumption, it is fair to
reward B with a lot more points for beating someone much higher than
their skill level, as they performed much better than our expected
belief of their skill.</p>
<p>This does not hold in Triathlon. Consider the 2019, women’s race in
Kona. Daniel Ryf went into the race with the following record.</p>
<p><img src="../TommyRank/pngs/daniel_2019.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>
<p>She had won every race she had participated in and went on to have an
off day at the race. On this day she came in at 13th. In a head to head
model, all 12 athletes that beat her did not necessarily race much
better than their expected skill. They might have done as was expected
of them. It just so happens that Daniela Ryf had a tough day and
performed much lower than her expected skill level. So it would seem
unfair to reward all of these other athletes as if they had performed
much better than expected because they beat the best athlete in the
world. We cannot take the results of a race, convert them to pairwise
head to head battles and use ELO. <a href="../PrimoRank/">Part III</a>
does just exactly this. Daniela is not rated as the worlds best
triathlete for that year. One could argue that this is not all that
unfair, and showing up on the biggest day is most important. This is a
philosophical debate we are not qualified to answer. In part III, we
describe in detail how one can use head to head battles to rank an
athlete.</p>
<p>What the PTO currently does, <strong>is ignore this problem
completely</strong>. They decided to base the scoring system based on an
expected finish time known as AIT. Every athlete races the clock. The
clock is there for every race. This ignores who you are racing or how
someone else does with respect to you. This is not a bad idea in
principle but winning a race with strong competitors is still harder
than winning a race with an easy field, regardless of the time.
Additionally we have shown that the the PTO clock is not stable across
courses. Given what we understand to be the incentives of the sport, one
cannot ignore this problem and also rank athletes. The results would not
be meaningful.</p>
<h3 id="its-really-hard-to-rank-this-sport">It’s really hard to rank
this sport</h3>
<p>Finally, despite critiquing the scoring for most of the document,
this is a reasonable baseline. The problem of ranking athletes that do
not race each other frequently is a hard maths problem. Many clever
people have tried. If you’re interested, you may read <a
href="https://lucas.maystre.ch/">Lucas Maystre</a>’s PhD thesis. People
really have been studying this for over a 100 years.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-from-here">Where to from here?</h2>
<p>We first recommend a model based purely on intuition. There is no
mathematical reasoning behind this. It’s trivial to understand and was
recommended by someone who actually did the sport and was good at it.
You can find it <a href="../TommyRank/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we take a more principled approach to describing what a
ranking could look like. We state are assumptions clearly and justify
them using case studies. That analysis can be found <a
href="../PrimoRank">here</a></p>
