<h1 id="the-tour-de-france-fantasy-game">The Tour De France Fantasy
Game</h1>
<p>Remember <a href="../ShannonDemon/">our friend Tom</a>? Yes, the one
with a gambling problem. Well, he’s back to give you free unsolicited
advice on how to build your Tour De France fantasy team. If you followed
along last time, you know Tom knows a thing or two about strategy.
Without Tom, you’re left to your faculty or worse, advice from <a
href="https://www.bicycling.com/tour-de-france/a36843568/tour-de-france-fantasy/">these
guys</a>. Of course, Tom will also bring his reliable counsellors
<em>Sexy Stephen</em> and <em>Bicyclist Ben</em> along. Now that the
stage is set, we briefly review the rules for our young Americans, who
might have erased the Tour from their memories.</p>
<pre><code>Disclaimer: At the time of writing, neither the cost of riders nor the race start list were released. We are also not responsible if you lose your life savings based on our advice.  If such a thing happens, we will pretend to be sad, however.</code></pre>
<h2 id="tdf-for-dummies">TDF for dummies</h2>
<p>The Tour De France is a 21-day bike race. Each day is called a stage.
The stage rank of a rider is determined by the order in which they
finish a stage. The GC rank of a rider is determined by the sum of their
finish time across stages. The lower the aggregate, the better placed
the rider (otherwise, it wouldn’t be much of a race). Some stages have
big mountains, and the skinny riders do well. Some are flat, which lends
itself to the “<em>skinnier than you but still called fat</em>” peloton
riders, often described as sprinters. Some have short hills between flat
sections, and only the cycling gods (and our friend Tom) know who’s
likely to win these. A few other competitions sprinkled throughout the
race, such as King of the mountains and points. The frequency and
placement of such segments are at the discretion of the masochistic
tendencies of the race director, which you can mostly ignore. We will
not spend too much time analysing them.</p>
<p><em>PICTURE</em></p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-score-points">How do you score points?</h2>
<p>You pick a team of nine riders. At the end of each stage, they
receive points based on the rules described in this <a
href="https://www.velogames.com/velogame/2021/scores.php">document</a>.
We review some of the important rules</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Winning stages</strong>: Below is how many points you can
score if a rider in your team wins a stage. The winner gets 220 points,
the second 180 and so on.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre

<ul>
<li><strong>Being in a good position overall</strong>: The general
classification position of a rider is obtained by summing the finish
time of the rider so far and sorting it in ascending order. Below are
how many points you can score by being high in the GC ranks. Every day a
rider leads the Tour De France, they are awarded 30 points.</li>

<ul>
<li>At the end of the tour, the riders are awarded an additional bonus
for their final GC position. The rider that finished the race with the
lowest aggregate time gets an additional 600 points and so on.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Points: Sprinkled across stages over 21 days are sections of road
riders sprint for to get points. This contributes towards the points
jersey (green jersey). Technically winning a sprint also does, but that
gets eaten up in winning GC. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Unlike GC and stage
– you don’t get double points for winning sprints and winning a
stage.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>intermediate_points <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="dv">20</span>, <span class="dv">16</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>, <span class="dv">6</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Summit Points: Finally, reaching the top of the mountain (depending
on the kind of mountain) first gets you some points. Reaching the top of
really steep mountains gives you more points than ascending a mountain
with a shallow gradient. <strong>OBSERVE: Those skinny GC riders usually
win the race by doing well on steep mountains. The excellent GC riders
will likely do very well on the steep climbs</strong> The rider that
reaches the top of the steep climbs first gets thirty points, second
gets twenty-five and so on.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Breakaway</strong> Not every rider can win stages and
ascent mountains first. Some riders accelerate early in the hope of some
camera time and lead the race for a while before being caught by the
peloton. If you are in a group of 30 riders or less and lead the race at
the 50% mark, you get 20 points. <strong>NOTE: These riders don’t have
to win races or get to the top of the mountain first. They try very hard
every day for some camera time, and they get nearly as many points as
the rider who gets to the top of the mountains first.</strong> These
riders are your friends. There are a handful of riders capable of
winning steep climbs. But almost everyone has somewhat of a chance at
being in the breakaway. Furthermore, these riders (unless serious GC
contenders) are available for cheap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assists</strong>: You get some points if your teammate
leads GC, wins a stage or your team is high in the team’s
classification. If you’ve picked the GC favourites, you likely have no
money left, so choosing the cheapest rider from the same team is an
affordable way of getting free points. Once again – even in this scoring
system, you are rewarded for getting GC right.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proxies-of-a-winning-team">Proxies of a winning team</h2>
<p>Suppose you run a sub-4-minute mile, then Bob’s your uncle. If you
can also ride up a 30 min climb at 6.2Watts/kg, then Bob is also your
aunty. In life, we often employ such arbitrary benchmarks to measure
goodness. So we asked our friend Tom if he could summarise the science
of picking the best fantasy team into some numbers. Biz-ness people love
summary statistics. Sure enough, he obliged (indeed, a man of many
talents) by writing a simulator that roughly approximates the Velogames
scores for different team selections.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to read this any further, read this as if you get
these metrics, you can be confident that you will win. The real
question, of course, is how to make a team that stands a realistic
chance at achieving these numbers.</p>
<p>We look at the 2022 Giro D Italia and 2021 Tour De France and analyse
some of the best-performing teams. We also look at winners of local
leagues and losers of local leagues. This small sample set guides our
intuition. We do not bother with providing evidence of generalisation or
writing down theorem/proofs. Whenever possible, we will do some
back-of-the-envelope heuristic calculations to justify our decisions. If
such analysis does not quench your thirst for scientific rigour, we
recommend building your own model and sharing it with us (or perhaps
just the profits).</p>
<p><strong>GIRO 2022</strong>: we looked at the top 5 teams in the
overall competition, 1 team that won a local league and 1 team which did
average. *When reporting means, we’ll report the mean and median (to let
the reader know if there could be heavy outliers)**</p>

<p>To win a local league of about 15 participants, we found a score of
7,331 was competitive. Beyond that, getting the GC winner was the most
important. The local winners among the ones we sampled averaged fourteen
total podiums on stages and seven individual podium riders.</p>
<p>The average local team had an MRR of 5,980, failed to pick the GC
rider and had 11 podiums with seven unique winners.</p>
<p>Notice that the unique podium winners are not that different across
the best teams and average teams. Even the total number of podiums is
not definitive. We reason later why this is the case. The short answer
is that this game is about picking the overall GC winners. The more GC
winners you choose, the better your chances. Of course, there are many
other features, such as time in the breakaway etc., but we focus on
these as the heavy hitters. Next, we look at the best-performing teams
on last year’s tour.</p>

<p>In last year’s tour edition, to win, it was just essential to get the
3 GC riders right. If you did that, you would have won your local
league. Roglic crashed, which meant this eliminated a large portion of
the betting field as well.</p>
<h2 id="general-advice">General advice</h2>
<p>With all of this out of the way, here’s some general advice about
picking a team.</p>
<h3 id="always-focus-on-gc">Always focus on GC</h3>
<p>You win by getting points. How do you earn points? You get points
through one of the streams: points, stage, GC, Kom etc. Perhaps this was
intentional, or maybe the game creator did not put thought into this,
but stages, GC and kom, are strongly related. So doing well in GC almost
gives you the other two for free. The prime focus of your team is to get
as many top 10 riders as possible. Forget sprints, ITT, Kom’s and
intermediate sprints. If this was not abundantly clear from the above
report, look at the case study in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-try-to-find-stage-hunters">Do not try to find stage
hunters</h3>
<p>Ok, you have your GC leaders – but chances are many people will get
this correct. How do you differentiate yourself? It would appear that
the next trick is to guess the stage winners.</p>
<p>Not really!</p>
<p><strong>FACT OF LIFE</strong>: It is impossible to get a good GC
result without doing well on stages on average. The converse, however,
is not valid. It is possible to be a stage hunter - win stages and do
terribly on GC.</p>
<p>In fact, in the actual world of professional cycling, winning a stage
is more revered than consistently coming top 10 on stages. However,
these stage hunters are useless in the nerd fantasy land of Velogames.
The reasoning comes from the fact of life.</p>
<p>Matej MOHORIČ won two breakaway stages at the Tour and was the talk
of the town. I ask you how did <a
href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/aleksey-lutsenko">LUTSENKO
Alexey</a> do? At the top of your head, you probably don’t remember – he
came 7th and didn’t win a stage. Mohoric ended up with 864 points, and
Alexey ended up with 932. He only cost two points more than Mohoric.
Additionally, predicting that a rider that is not a unicorn wins two
stages of the same tour is quite hard. On the other hand, predicting a
top 10 is relatively more straightforward.</p>
<p>As good GC implies good performance on most stages, those riders will
benefit from both the GC scoring stream and the stage scoring stream
(and often the KOM scoring system). However, stage hunters will languish
at the back of the race on most stages and sacrifice their GC ambitions
for the benefit of winning one or maybe even two stages. They don’t get
the KOM or GC position points for free.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-sprinters-and-points">What about sprinters and
points?</h3>
<p>It’d be great if I could fill my team with top 10 GC riders, but
they’re expensive. I cannot afford them all. So who should I pick after
I’m done trying to guess the top two/three GC winners? A sprinter –
there are not that many of them at any given race. Usually, each team
has one (and some don’t even bother). Teams with a designated sprinter
use the other riders to form a sprint train, thereby giving their
sprinter the best chance at winning a sprint stage. Sprint stages have a
flat finish and are not usually preceded by steep mountains. Sometimes
they can be – and it becomes hard to predict if the race would end up
going to a sprinter or a breakaway rider.</p>
<p>We look back at the last few grand tours to understand how many
stages are contested by the GC group, breakaway riders and sprinters.
Before the first proper mountain stage, races are often won between
punchy sprinters and big boy sprinters.</p>

<p>Although there are many breakaway wins, the variance across the
sprint field podium is much less. It was much harder to predict Magnus
Corts’s performance than JAKOBSEN Fabio. Both won 3 stages. But Fabio
was 2nd on the two sprint stages. He didn’t win. Magnus Cort was not
competitive on days he didn’t decide to attack.</p>

<p>Breakaway wins: 8 Sprinter wins: 7</p>
<p>Nearly the same number – there are fewer sprinters than breakaway
riders (but sadly, you’re not allowed to pick many. Here’s where picking
riders that are not classified as sprinters but can sprint helps. MVDP,
Wout, Biniam etc. )</p>
<p>The nice thing about a sprint stage is that it is an independent
event. This implies if your favourite sprinter blows their tits out on
Day 1, it has no repercussions towards their next sprint stage win. This
means it is hard to go wrong in picking an excellent or above-average
sprinter. <strong>NOTE: the only real risk is that they crash as sprints
are chaotic</strong>. Additionally, even if they don’t win, they’ll
place relatively high (see below).</p>
<p>Depending on the profile of the course, picking a sprinter that
climbs a little bit can help. It means they are still competitive
despite climbing over mid-race lumps. Wout Van Aert, Mathieu Van Der
Poel and Biniam Girmay seem to be good shouts. Speaking of race profiles
– here’s what the first seven days look like.</p>

<p>Unless Wout Van Aert crashes – he is competitive for the first six
stages of this race. Assuming he comes top 5 in all 6 of them – he could
accumulate about</p>
<p><strong>VERDICT</strong>: Wout Van Aert must be in your team. Note he
also gets assist points from Roglic or Jonas. <em>Alternatives</em>:
Mathieu Van Der Poel, Biniam Girmay, Climby version of Caleb Ewan (if
they’re considerably cheaper)</p>
<h3 id="unicorns-exist-for-a-reason---for-you-to-pick-them">Unicorns
exist for a reason - for you to pick them</h3>
<p>If your race start list has the following names and there are no
abnormal circumstances surrounding them (like injuries, covid, crashes,
clear indication of bad from leading up to the race) – you have to
select as many of them as you can without blowing your budget. + Tadej
POGAČAR + Primož ROGLIČ</p>
<p><strong>The way they ride, they win by A LOT</strong></p>
<p>Roglic crashed out on stage 7 of the tour and left with 537 points,
whereas Magnus Cort finished 56th on the tour and ended up with 489
points. Roglic finished in the top K of the finishers on tour. That’s
just when one of them crashes.</p>
<p>Tadej has never crashed out (though probability says it is imminent),
and when Roglic does finish, they usually end with __ points more than
the other guys.</p>
<p><strong>VERDICT</strong>: Pick both of them. If you like the all-in
strategy, you bet that one, if not both, will crash or have a terrible
day; You’re left with all this money to spend elsewhere. We argue that
this is not beneficial – but if winning the overall is the only
satisfactory goal, and you’re willing to risk coming last in your local
league, your best strategy is to drop both of them.</p>
<p><strong>The risk:</strong> This is not top-secret information – they
are usually the most expensive riders. If one of them crashes out, your
team’s chances of winning are likely toast. However, there’s not much
wisdom in trying to be clever. Even if one of them did crash out, you
still have to predict which rider will perform above their abilities to
replace them in the ranking. Good riders crash less frequently than
average riders – this is why they are good riders. Expensive riders are
often good riders. So on average, you’re better off trying not to be too
clever. Of course, our friend Tom only maximises your chances of doing
well on expectation. If you want deterministic guarantees, we recommend
you consult your horoscope instead.</p>
<h3 id="pick-a-unicorn-supporter">Pick a unicorn supporter</h3>
<p>You’ve picked a unicorn, and they cost you your mortgage, pension and
left kidney. Save some costs by choosing the cheapest member from their
team to win some assist points. You get to pick nine riders – not all of
them will be equally useful. Trying for them all to be similarly
valuable is destined to fail. For night there is the day; for Wout,
there is Nathan Van Hooydonck.</p>
