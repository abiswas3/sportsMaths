<p><code>Primo lecture series in mathematics: Shannon's Demon</code></p>
<h1 id="my-friend-tom">My friend Tom</h1>
<p>My friend Tom is a real man’s man. He fears no man, surfs with
sharks, descends on a bike without using his hands and goes even as far
as opening his worldle without vowels. It was only a matter of time,
before such a man found himself on the roulette tables of the Cambridge
Stock Exchange(CSE). With a gun in his holster and cowboy boots from
Essex, he will certainly not be investing in the diversified public the
market or be tracking index funds. No, not our Tom. He’s here to bet on
individual volatile stocks - like those pictures of crypto cats. He sees
things that no one else sees. The question is, what does he really
see?</p>
<h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2>
<p>The CSE is a very simple market place – it has a single stock whose
price either doubles or halves everyday with equal probability. At the
tables of this exchange we have three characters – <em>Sexy Steve</em>,
<em>Bicyclist Ben</em> and our friend Tom. Tied at the hip since birth,
these three punters do everything together. All three of them observe
that on average they stand to gain <span
class="math inline">\(1.25\)</span> dollars per 1 dollar invested.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> be the random variable
depicting how much money I have after one day and <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> denote how much money I start with. We
have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[Y] &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\text{ Money double } +
\frac{1}{2}\text{ half } \\
&amp;= X + \frac{1}{4}X \\
&amp;= 1.25X
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Setting <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> we see we get <span
class="math inline">\(1.25\)</span> dollars per <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> dollar invested on average.</p>
<h2 id="sexy-steve-and-bicylist-ben-have-a-go">Sexy Steve and Bicylist
Ben have a go</h2>
<p><em>Sexy Steve</em>, known in the rougher parts of Cambridgeshire as
a ladies man decides to invest first. <em>Deceitful Doug</em> tells him
about the benefits of compound interest, and observing that he makes a
profit on average he decides to let his <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> dollar sit for a long time.</p>
<p><em>Bicyclist Ben</em> has spent years in the professional cycling
peloton splitting his valuable time between recreational drug users and
miserable sports dopers. He knows how to spot bad advice from miles out.
He knows to get compound interest to work, the geometric expectation of
the random variable must be positive. Above we only have the arithmetic
expectation to be positive. More on what those fancy words mean later,
but this is what Ben does. Regardless of the outcome of the day, he
cashes out everyday, and puts a fresh <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> dollar into the pot. “Madness!” shouts
<em>Sexy Steve</em>, “haven’t you heard of compound interest??”</p>
<p>Below we show a uniform sub sample of all the possible outcomes for
Steve and Ben. A green line indicates that a profit has been made. The
dreaded red indicates those money-grabbing sleazebags at CSE have
won.</p>
<p>Despite having a net positive daily expectation; <em>Sexy steve</em>
either makes it big or goes bust with equal probability. He did get all
the benefits of compound interest with all drawbacks of losing money
equally equally. With this strategy, Stephen is playing roulette.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/steve.png" width=50% height=50%></img></p>
<p>Benjamin on the other hand, almost never loses any money on the long
run. The shrewd bike rider avoided all the pot holes and crashes only to
get linear growth in pay. While Benjamin grew richer almost certainly,
he only gained enough riches to afford himself 1 day at the go karts
after days of saving – but taking inflation into account, poor old Ben
did not even get his day at the races.</p>

<h2 id="re-balance-and-diversify">Re-balance and diversify</h2>
<p>Tom opts for the simple strategy which he borrowed from Claude
Shannon when they met in the gambling tables of Las Vegas in the early
50s. He takes his 1 dollar and invests half of it. The rest he saves. At
the end of the day, he adds his earnings and then invests half; and
saves the other half. He repeats this process every-day. Can Tom be
exponentially rich without any risks?</p>
<p><img src="pngs/tom.png" width=50% height=50%></img></p>
<p>Oh yes he can :-)</p>
<h2 id="what-just-happened">What just happened ?</h2>
<p>Well if you talk to a financial expert they might throw out words
like Kelly’s principle or volatility drag or parrando paradox. To be
fair, I did not the original paper by Kelly nor do I know what those
words actually mean. So I’ll explain it using some middle school
mathematics.</p>
